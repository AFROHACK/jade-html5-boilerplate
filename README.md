# Jade HTML5 Boilerplate
#### Simple port of [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) to [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/)
[Dan Motzenbecker](http://oxism.com/), MIT License

Discretionary portions of the original HTML5 Boilerplate are included,
but left as unbuffered comments by default. Uncomment to enable them.

`layout.jade` uses [Express](http://expressjs.com/)-based resource paths,
while `layout_vanilla.jade` uses the originals.

Run `./build` to output the templates as HTML files.

Run `./test` to test the template renderings against references.
