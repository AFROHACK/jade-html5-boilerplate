Discretionary portions of the original HTML5 Boilerplate are included, but left as unbuffered comments by default. Uncomment to enable them.

Elements with dynamic content (title, description, author) are also commented out by default.

layout.jade uses Express-based resource paths, while layout_vanilla.jade uses the originals.
